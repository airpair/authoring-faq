##1. How to Create a Post

New posts start in ***Draft*** and are completely private. They have no git repo or history log. If you start something and your idea never goes anywhere, that experience was just for you. You can change everything as much as you like, so enjoy not taking things too seriously until you realize you want to.  

**Once you are logged in:**

####1.1 Go to: [https://www.airpair.com/posts](/posts)

####1.6 Press **Submit for Review**

When you have written at least 500 words, and you feel it's ready to be reviewed by the AirPair Community, press **Submit for Review**. 

When you submit your post we create a GitHub repo to begin tracking all changes via Git. Repo names across our org are unique and are locked once you submit, so make sure you are 100% happy when you submit.

Once submitted, your post will be available for forking here: [https://www.airpair.com/posts/review](/posts/in-community-review), visible to reviewers logged in to AirPair. It is still hidden from open traffic and marked as noindex just in case.

### 2. How to Edit your Post

Once your post is submitted, you have the choice to continue editing on AirPair, or clone your repo and use any editor of your choosing. Either way, each time you save your post, including from the editor, it gets committed to master on github. The markdown appearing in the editor comes from HEAD and ***it will not appear on airpair.com until you publish changes from head back to AirPair**. 

This allows us to give you a preview feature without having to change your live copy. Althought not quite semantically correct, you can think of HEAD as your working branch, and the copy stored in AirPair's mongo instance as your prod branch. 

>Before you start editing, if it's been more than a few hours since you forked this post, we highly recommend updating your fork so not to suggest edits on an old version of the post.

### 4. How to Accept Edits on your Post

Simply pull and accept changes. 


### 5. How to Self Publish your Post

Published posts can take advantage of all the same forking and merging goodness as the review phase, with the exception the author needs an editor with permissions to update the live copy on AirPair. 

Posts will appear at the top of our posts section and RSS feeds and will be fully indexed by google. Distiguished works will be promoted by AirPair's marketing team for additional exposure.
